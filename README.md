# Component Library

## Technologies Used

- React, 
- Storybook 
- JavaScript
- CSS 
- Mockup provided in  Adobe XD


## Requirements

- Runs without errors
- Include the required components in the Adobe XD Mock-up
- Be deployed to GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Surge
- Be published to the NPM Package Registry
- Includes a README 

## Objective

Objective was to create a library of React components that mimick the mock up proved in Adobe XD.

## Approach

All of the needed components were mapped out.  Each component type was reviewed to determine if it should be a functional or class component.  Once components were created, CSS was used to replicate the look provided in Adobe XD.

## Future Updates

There are some small tweaks to be made to a couple of the components.  Code will also be reviewed for formatting and readability.
